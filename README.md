Trained CatBoostRegressor [model](./house_prices) to predict house prices from [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) 

In this report I have analyzed principles of the gradient boosting algorithm, used it on different datasets (regression and classification, numerical and categorical) and comapred it's quality and feature importances with linear models
